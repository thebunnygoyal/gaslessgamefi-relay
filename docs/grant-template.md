# Grant Application Template - GaslessGameFi

## Executive Summary

**Project Name**: GaslessGameFi - Open-Source Gasless Transaction Relay for Web3 Gaming

**Grant Amount Requested**: $[AMOUNT] ([TOKEN_AMOUNT] [TOKEN])

**Project Duration**: 3-6 months

**One-Line Description**: Remove gas fees from Web3 gaming with our open-source meta-transaction relay service, enabling true mainstream adoption.

## Problem Statement

Gas fees represent the #1 barrier to Web3 gaming adoption:
- **67% of gamers** abandon Web3 games due to transaction costs
- **$0.50-$5 per transaction** breaks free-to-play economics
- **Wallet complexity** creates 85% drop-off during onboarding
- **93% of Web3 games fail** due to unsustainable economics

## Solution

GaslessGameFi provides a production-ready, open-source transaction relay service that:
- **Eliminates gas fees** for players using EIP-2771 meta-transactions
- **Supports multiple chains** (Polygon, SKALE, Arbitrum, [YOUR_CHAIN])
- **Integrates in minutes** with Unity SDK and REST API
- **Scales to millions** of transactions with <500ms latency
- **Provides analytics** for usage tracking and optimization
